title: DroneSploit at Black Hat Europe Arsenal
subtitle: Demonstration of the current capabilities of this brand new drone-focused pentesting framework
---

Our brand new drone hacking framework was presented at Black Hat Europe Arsenal on Dec 5th, 2019. It was a pleasure to demonstrate its basic features to a large audience. We hope to attract some contributors in a near future to develop modules for other models of drones !

The BlackHat presentation is available on [DroneSploit's home page](/dronesploit)...
