  job:      IT Security Expert
  
  summary: I'm a computer security professional, passionate about cybersecurity and programming (especially Python). My main goals are to constantly improve my competences, provide meticulous quality work and to share knowledge with other professionals. My current field of development is the Application Security for building secure environments in depth. For this purpose, I try to study as much related matters as possible in order to turn this knowledge into exploitable projects and processes.\nIn my spare time, I love going abroad with my sweetheart for doing exciting activities like rafting, scuba diving, hiking and so forth.
